      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi nice to meet you.  My name is John Merritt and I am an Associate Scientist at Target Discovery Inc.  
        My career objective is to become an expert in high-throughput molecular biology lab research, utilizing python, 
        bioinformatics, and automation of innovative techniques. I want to grow business and social connections to promote other peopleâ€™s 
        constructive career objectives and my own. High-throughput lab research, combined with clinical implementation, can allow doctors to
        prescribe more personalized medicines.
